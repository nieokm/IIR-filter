This is a C++ realisation of IIR filter:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response

The user writes down the filter coefficients in a line. The number of non-zero coefficients is arbitrary. After that, the program takes a signal from input.txt and write down the filtered signal.

Here is an example of the work of the filter. 3 signals (sinosoidal, sum of two sinusoidal, white noise) written in inputX.txt were generated by generator.cpp, after that it were filtered with coefficients [1] / [-1] (integrator).

The result is visualised in graphs.png.
